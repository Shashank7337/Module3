ERC20 Token Smart Contract

This Solidity program is a simple contract that implements the ERC20 token standard. The purpose of the contract is to demonstrate the basic functionality of an ERC20 token, including token creation, transfers, and balance inquiries.

Description

This contract simulates an ERC20 token implementation. ERC20 is a widely adopted standard interface for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows users to create tokens, transfer them to other addresses, and check their token balances.

The contract includes the following key features:
Token creation: Users can create a fixed supply of tokens when deploying the contract.
Token transfers: Users can transfer tokens from their own address to another address.
Balance inquiry: Users can check the token balance of a specific address.
The contract utilizes the ERC20 standard functions, including totalSupply, balanceOf, transfer, and transferFrom, to provide the basic functionality of an ERC20 token.

Getting Started

Executing Program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE.

Go to the Remix website at Remix Ethereum IDE.
Click on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar to create a new file. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol).
Copy and paste the provided code into the file.
To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.0" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.
Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the MyToken contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the various functions such as transfer, approve, transferFrom, mint, and burn.
Make sure to set the appropriate function parameters and provide the necessary approvals when required.
